# Implementation of TCP Congestion Control algorithms
The Project is a python Simulation of congestion control algorithms and concluding the best algorithm by changing parameters
Collected and analysed key performance metrics,including the number of messages sent and received,retransmission rates and ACK packets sent 
Developed and presented comprehensive slides on TCP congestion control
